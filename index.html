  <h2>The Story So Far</h2>
  <p>We first met each other in the work lift after Sam accepted a job in London. A 6-month friendship bloomed from a mutual love for music, cigarettes and comedy shows. After going to see the Phenomenal Handclap Band for the second time in 1 week (and a bit of intervention from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheTeddyHolmes">Ed Holmes</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/camilla.d.caires">Camilla McCusker nee de Caires</a>) we realised we both held huge crushes on the other and overnight our friendship transformed into a relationship.</p>

  <p>Sam is 3 years Sasha’s junior and our colleagues welcomed the news with <a href="http://bigassmessage.com/f3afc" target="_blank">this</a>. Needless to say we’ve always kept a bit of humour and silliness around.</p>

  <p>5 years on, there has been 1 proposal, 1 surrogate child in the form of a cat called Rufus, 6 new jobs, 1 mortgage and 118 floorboards laid with a lot of help from family. We look forward to becoming a kickass husband and wife team.</p>
